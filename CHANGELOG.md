# Changelog

This file records user-visible changes to the public package.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added the `dev` integration branch contract, tracked local Git hooks, a pull-request template, and executable CI policy checks for task and release pull requests.

### Changed

- Defined `task branch -> dev -> main` as the repository delivery path, with routine work squash-merged into `dev` and releases merged from `dev` into `main`.
- Updated contribution guidance to reflect the existing MIT license and private maintainer-review phase.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added an executable npm package-boundary test that compares the real tarball
  with the approved allowlist, verifies all ten entrypoints and local imports,
  and loads the packed entrypoints from an unpacked candidate.
- Added public contribution, support, security, conduct, and CI contracts for
  release review.
- Added the MIT license, retained third-party notices, and final repository/npm
  metadata for `@kroffske/locus-pi`.

### Changed

- Limited the npm candidate to the ten default Pi extensions, their explicit
  runtime and documentation closure, and the three curated Package workflows:
  `live-smoke`, `llm-smoke`, and `requirements-grill`.
- Moved the AST search, preview, and resolve implementations under the active
  `ast-structural-edit` owner.
- Reduced production dependencies to the packages required by the public
  runtime surface.

### Removed

- Removed beta modules, uncurated workflow examples, reports, galleries,
  transcripts, benchmarks, evaluations, archives, and private runtime or
  planning paths from the npm candidate.
- Removed the repository-only `pi-live-terminal` executable from the npm
  package boundary.

### Security

- Verified the candidate with secret scanning, production dependency audit,
  source tests, and actual tarball inspection. These checks are evidence, not a
  substitute for the remaining human release gates.
